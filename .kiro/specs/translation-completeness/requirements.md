# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The application currently has incomplete translations for French and Italian languages. While English and German have 98 translation keys, French and Italian only have 34 keys each. This creates a poor user experience for French and Italian users who will see untranslated text (English fallbacks) throughout the application, particularly on the landing page, onboarding flow, and various UI components.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a French-speaking user, I want to see the entire application interface in French, so that I can fully understand and navigate the salon management system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN a user goes through onboarding in French THEN all onboarding steps and labels SHALL be in French
3. WHEN a user navigates the main application in French THEN all sidebar navigation, buttons, and UI elements SHALL be in French
4. WHEN a user encounters error messages in French THEN the error messages SHALL be displayed in French
5. WHEN a user views client management features in French THEN all client-related text SHALL be in French

### Requirement 2

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all translation files to have the same keys, so that the translation system works consistently across all supported languages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN comparing translation files THEN French, Italian, English, and German SHALL have the same number of keys
2. WHEN a translation key exists in English THEN it SHALL also exist in French, Italian, and German

4. WHEN new translation keys are added THEN they SHALL be added to all language files simultaneously

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a quality assurance tester, I want to verify translation completeness, so that I can ensure no untranslated text appears in the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running translation tests THEN all language files SHALL report the same number of keys
2. WHEN testing the application in any language THEN no English fallback text SHALL appear
3. WHEN switching between languages THEN all UI elements SHALL update to the selected language
4. WHEN accessing any page or feature THEN all text SHALL be properly translated
