# Cloudflare Pages MIME Type Fix

## Problem Diagnosed
The domain kimba.ch was downloading the HTML file instead of rendering it in the browser. This typically happens due to:
1. Incorrect MIME type headers
2. Missing Content-Type headers 
3. Browser not recognizing the file as HTML

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `_redirects` file
- Added proper SPA routing rule: `/* /index.html 200`
- This ensures all routes serve the index.html for single-page application

### 2. Enhanced `_headers` file
- Added explicit Content-Type headers with charset
- Added security headers (X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options)
- Specific handling for root path `/`

### 3. Improved `functions/_middleware.js`
- Added explicit handling for root path (`/` or empty)
- Enhanced MIME type definitions with charset
- Added security headers to all responses
- Improved error handling

### 4. Added backup `.htaccess` file
- Apache/server-level MIME type enforcement
- Fallback SPA routing rules

### 5. Created test file
- Added `test.html` for diagnosing MIME type issues
- Simple page to verify browser rendering

## Testing Steps

After deployment, test these URLs:
1. `https://kimba.ch` - Should load the main application
2. `https://kimba.ch/test.html` - Should show "Test Page Working"
3. Any SPA route like `https://kimba.ch/dashboard` - Should load the app

## Key Technical Changes

**MIME Types Enhanced:**
- `text/html; charset=utf-8` (was `text/html`)
- `application/javascript; charset=utf-8` (was `application/javascript`)
- `text/css; charset=utf-8` (was `text/css`)

**Security Headers Added:**
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY`

**Root Path Handling:**
```javascript
// Explicit handling for root path
if (pathname === '/' || pathname === '') {
  const indexResponse = await env.ASSETS.fetch(new URL('/index.html', request.url));
  return new Response(indexResponse.body, {
    status: 200,
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'text/html; charset=utf-8',
      // ... other headers
    }
  });
}
```

## Expected Results
- Browser should render HTML instead of downloading it
- All routes should work properly
- Static assets should load with correct MIME types
- No more file download prompts

## If Issues Persist
1. Check browser developer tools Network tab for Content-Type headers
2. Try the test page: `kimba.ch/test.html`
3. Clear browser cache completely
4. Check Cloudflare Pages deployment logs for any errors
